[0:30-1:00] - HOOK & OVERVIEW

PRESENTER:
"Here's what we're covering: what foreigners CAN buy, what they can't, the legal process, costs involved, and three critical mistakes to avoid. Let's start with the most common question..."

Text Overlay - List:
✓ What You Can Buy
✓ What You Can't Buy
✓ Legal Process
✓ Total Costs
✓ Mistakes to Avoid

B-roll: Pattaya property scenes

---

[1:00-2:00] - MAIN POINT 1: WHAT FOREIGNERS CAN BUY

PRESENTER:
"First, good news: foreigners CAN legally own condominiums in Thailand with full freehold ownership. However, there's a rule - no more than 49% of a building's units can be foreign-owned. This is called the 'foreign quota.'"

(Pause for graphic)

"So when you're looking at properties, always ask: 'Is foreign quota available?' If a building is full on foreign quota, you'd need to buy under Thai quota, which has different rules I'll explain."

Graphics:
- Animated diagram showing 49% foreign quota rule

B-roll:

Text Overlays:
- 49% FOREIGN QUOTA RULE
- FREEHOLD OWNERSHIP ✓
- ASK ABOUT QUOTA AVAILABILITY

---

[2:00-3:00] - MAIN POINT 2: WHAT FOREIGNERS CANNOT BUY

PRESENTER:
"Now, what you CANNOT own: land. Foreigners cannot own land in Thailand under most circumstances. This means you cannot own houses or villas in your name in the traditional sense."

(Pause)

"However - and this is important - you CAN own the house structure itself through a lease arrangement, typically 30 years renewable. Or you can use a Thai company structure, though this requires careful legal setup and comes with considerations we can discuss in a consultation."

Graphics:
- "Land Ownership: NO" with X
- "House Structure Lease: YES" with checkmark

B-roll:

- Lawyer consultation scenes

Text Overlays:
- CANNOT OWN LAND ✗
- CAN LEASE 30 YEARS ✓
- COMPANY STRUCTURE POSSIBLE

---

[3:00-3:45] - MAIN POINT 3: THE BUYING PROCESS

PRESENTER:
"The actual buying process is straightforward. Once you've found your property and negotiated the price, here's what happens:"

(Walking through steps)

"Step one: Reservation - you pay a reservation fee, typically 50,000 to 100,000 baht to secure the unit.

Step two: Due diligence - verify the property title, check foreign quota availability, review all documents. We handle this for our clients.

Step three: Contract - sign the purchase agreement and pay a deposit, usually 30% of the purchase price.

Step four: Transfer - you'll need a Thai bank account showing funds brought from overseas. On transfer day, you pay the balance and register the property at the Land Office. Title deed transferred, you own it."

[3:45-4:15] - POINT 4: TOTAL COSTS

PRESENTER:
"Let's talk about the real cost because it's not just the property price. Here's what you need to budget for:"

(Running through list)

"Purchase price - that's obvious.
Transfer fee - about 2% of the registered value, typically split with seller.
Stamp duty or withholding tax - around 1%, depending on structure.
Legal fees - budget 30,000 to 50,000 baht for lawyer review.
If financing: mortgage fees and bank costs.
Agent fees - typically paid by the seller, but confirm.
And don't forget: sinking fund and maintenance fees once you own."

---

[4:15-4:45] - CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID

PRESENTER:
"Before we wrap up, three critical mistakes I see foreigners make:

Mistake one: Not verifying foreign quota availability before falling in love with a property.

Mistake two: Skipping independent legal review. Always have your own lawyer.

Mistake three: Not understanding ongoing costs. Those maintenance fees are forever - make sure you budget for them.

Avoid these and you'll be ahead of 90% of buyers."

[4:45-5:00] - SUMMARY & CTA

PRESENTER:
"So, quick recap: foreigners can own condos under the foreign quota, cannot own land, the process is straightforward with the right guidance, and total costs run about 3-4% beyond purchase price.
