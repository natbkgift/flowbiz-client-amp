Music: Continues

WHY IT WORKS:
- Shows bedroom exists (studio vs. 1BR)
- Immediate availability noted
- Checkmark = positive psychology

=========================================
SHOT 5: THE MATH (0:10-0:14)
=========================================
Timing: 10-14 seconds
Visual: Balcony view or back in living room
Text Overlay (animated in sequence):
- "฿2.8M ÷ 25 years"
- "= ฿9,300/month"
- "Your rent: ฿15,000+/month"
Transition: Hold on final number
Music: Beat hits on final number

WHY IT WORKS:
- Simple math makes it understandable
- Comparison to rent = "aha moment"
- Shows ownership cheaper than renting

PRODUCTION NOTE:
- Calculator animation in post
- Numbers need to be accurate
- Could use phone calculator screen recording

=========================================
SHOT 6: PRESENTER REVEAL (0:14-0:16)
=========================================
Timing: 14-16 seconds
Visual: Back to presenter, slight smile/knowing look
Text Overlay: "Cheaper than rent 🤯"
Transition: Cut to CTA
Music: Continues

WHY IT WORKS:
- Human connection
- Reinforces the hook concept
- Mind-blown emoji = shareability

=========================================
SHOT 7: CALL TO ACTION (0:16-0:18)
=========================================
Timing: 16-18 seconds
Visual: Property exterior or logo background
Text Overlay: 
- "DM us 'CONDO' 📩"
- "@AMPpattaya"
Transition: End
Music: Concludes

WHY IT WORKS:
- Clear next step
- "DM us 'CONDO'" = easy response
- Builds engagement (DMs boost algorithm)

PRODUCTION NOTE:
- Simple, clean CTA
- Large readable text
- Could use native TikTok/IG end card

=========================================

OVERALL STRATEGY:

Hook Formula:
Challenge assumption (costs less than rent) → Prove it (show property + math) → CTA

Platform Optimization:
✓ Vertical 9:16 format
✓ Text-heavy (many watch without sound)
✓ Fast-paced (18 seconds = attention span)
✓ Native format (POV)
✓ Engagement CTA (DM request)

Shooting Notes:
- Can shoot entire video in one property visit (30-45 minutes)
- Need: Phone or camera with gimbal, presenter, tripod for static shots
- Natural lighting preferred
- Shoot multiple versions (try different hooks)

Editing Notes:
- Use CapCut or TikTok native editor for authenticity
- Add trending sound if relevant
- Text: Large, bold, easy to read
- Captions: Auto-generate for accessibility
- Hashtags: #PattayaProperty #CondoForSale #RealEstateTikTok #PropertyInvestment #Thailand

Testing Variations:
Try different hooks with same footage:
- "POV: Your monthly rent could be buying you this"
- "Renting in Pattaya? You're throwing money away"
- "This condo costs 9,300 baht per month (but you own it)"

Success Metrics:
- Watch time (target: 80%+ completion rate)
- Saves (indicates high value)
- Shares (indicates surprising/useful)
- DM responses (actual leads)
- Profile visits

Budget: Minimal
- Can shoot on smartphone
- Free editing apps
- Time investment: 2-3 hours total

## Storyboarding Best Practices

### Before You Start Storyboarding

1. **Have a script or detailed concept**
   - Know what you're visualizing
   - Understand the narrative arc
   - Identify key messages

2. **Understand your constraints**
   - Location access and timing
   - Equipment available
   - Budget limitations
   - Crew size and skills

3. **Know your platform requirements**
   - Aspect ratio (9:16 vs 16:9 vs 1:1)
   - Duration limits
   - Platform-native styles

4. **Research visual references**
   - Find examples of similar videos
   - Note what works well
   - Identify style preferences

### During Storyboarding

1. **Think in sequences, not just shots**
   - How shots flow together
   - Transitions between ideas
   - Pacing and rhythm

2. **Be specific but flexible**
   - Detailed enough to guide production
   - Flexible enough for on-set adjustments
   - Include alternatives for problem shots

3. **Consider practical production**
   - Group shots by location to save time
   - Note difficult/time-consuming shots
   - Identify shots that can be cut if needed

4. **Plan for post-production**
   - Where graphics will go
   - Text overlay space
   - Color grading needs
   - Music sync points

## From Storyboard to Production

### Creating a Shot List from Storyboard

Once storyboard is approved, create a shot list organized by:

**Location** (shoot all shots in one place together)
```

```
SETUP: Tripod wide shots

Shot 1: Exterior (tripod, wide angle)
Shot 15: Living room (tripod, wide angle)
Shot 22: Bedroom (tripod, wide angle)

Equipment: Tripod, 16-24mm lens
Move through property systematically
```

**Time of Day** (when natural light matters)
```
GOLDEN HOUR (5:30-6:00 PM):

Shot 1: Exterior drone
Shot 20: Balcony view
Shot 25: Pool area

Must shoot during this window!
Backup plan if cloudy: reschedule
```

### Pre-Production Meeting

Walk production team through storyboard:
- Show visual reference
- Explain intent of each sequence
- Discuss technical approach
- Identify challenges
- Assign responsibilities
- Confirm equipment needs
- Review timeline

### On-Set Use of Storyboard

- Print or have digital copy accessible
- Check off shots as completed
- Note any deviations or creative changes
- Capture backup shots/alternatives
- Review footage against storyboard before wrapping

### Post-Production Reference

- Editor uses storyboard as assembly guide
- Graphics team knows exactly where elements go
- Review cut against storyboard
- Identify any missing shots (reshoot or adjust)
- Maintain planned pacing and flow
