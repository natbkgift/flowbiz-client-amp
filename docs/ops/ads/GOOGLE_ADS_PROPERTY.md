Campaign 3 (Brand): 3,000 THB/month (~100 THB/day)

### Scaling Budget (After optimization)

```
If Cost per Lead < 500 THB and leads are quality:
→ Increase budget by 20-30% monthly
→ Scale best-performing campaigns
→ Maintain or reduce poor performers

If Cost per Lead > 1,000 THB:
→ Pause and optimize
→ Review keywords, ads, landing pages
→ Consider reducing budget temporarily
```

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics (Property Industry)

```
Click-Through Rate (CTR): 2-4%
Cost Per Click (CPC): 10-30 THB
Conversion Rate: 3-8%
Cost Per Lead: 300-800 THB
Lead-to-Sale Conversion: 2-5%

Example Calculation:
1,000 impressions
→ 30 clicks (3% CTR) @ 20 THB CPC = 600 THB spent
→ 2 leads (6.7% CVR) = 300 THB per lead
→ 0.1 sale (5% lead-to-sale) = 6,000 THB per sale
```

### Monthly Targets (24,000 THB budget)

```
Impressions: 30,000-50,000
Clicks: 800-1,200
Cost per Click: 20-30 THB
Leads: 30-50
Cost per Lead: 480-800 THB
