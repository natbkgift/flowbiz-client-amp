## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### Template 19: Price Too High

```
I understand your concern about the price! 💰

Let me provide some context:

📊 MARKET COMPARISON:
This property: [X.XX]M THB | [XX] sqm = [XX,XXX] THB/sqm
Similar units in area: [XX,XXX] - [XX,XXX] THB/sqm
Market average: [XX,XXX] THB/sqm

💡 WHY THIS PRICE:
• [Reason 1: e.g., sea view]
• [Reason 2: e.g., better floor, corner unit]
• [Reason 3: e.g., renovated, fully furnished]
• [Reason 4: e.g., foreign quota, ready transfer]

💰 OPTIONS:
1️⃣ Make an offer - owner might negotiate!
2️⃣ Look at other units (different floor/view = lower price)
3️⃣ Consider payment plans (if available)
4️⃣ Wait for off-season discounts (May-September)

I can show you some alternative options at [lower budget] if you'd like?

Or we can make an offer and see what happens - you never know! 😊

What would you prefer?
```

**Use:** When price is objection
**Tone:** Understanding, helpful, solutions-oriented

---

### Template 20: Need More Time to Decide

```
Absolutely! Take all the time you need! 🙂

This is a big decision and you should be 100% comfortable.

💭 THINGS TO CONSIDER:

• Research the building/developer
• Get legal advice if needed

📋 I CAN HELP YOU DECIDE:

• Connect you with current owners
• Share building juristic details

⏰ NO PRESSURE!
However, I should mention:
[If urgent: "This property has X other interested parties"]
[If not urgent: "No rush! It's been on market for X days"]

Take your time, and when you're ready, I'm here! 😊

Is there anything specific holding you back that I can help clarify?
