## 1) Investment Snapshot

- **Asset Type:** Ultra‑Luxury beachfront condominium (Off‑Plan)
- **Core Thesis:** Scarcity beachfront + premium location (Wongamat) + flagship positioning → long-term value preservation
- **Best-fit investors:** HNWI / long‑term hold / lifestyle investors who want optional rental income

---

## 2) Yield & Return Language (Compliance First)

### What we can say
- Rental yield is a **projection/estimate** based on market conditions and assumptions below.
- Actual results depend on: ADR (daily rate), occupancy, seasonality, unit type/view, competition, fees, and owner usage.

### Words to avoid
- “Guaranteed yield”, “100%”, “risk‑free”, “sure return”, “forever”, “รับประกันผลตอบแทน”

## 3) Rental Yield Projection (How to Quote Safely)

> **Projection range (when properly supported):** ~**6–8%/year**  
> **Important:** Always specify **gross vs net** and attach assumptions + fees + program terms.

Do not quote “6–8%” publicly unless you can attach:
1) assumptions table
2) fee schedule
3) managed program contract terms (or written offer)

---
